```python
print("Hello World")
```

I always have random projects going on - recent projects include an Android + BLE controlled tank, mini-mame, self driving RC car, etc - and tend to get distracted(some times for months) and forget the things that I've learned.  I intend to use this blog as a scratch pad to help me remember things.  Additionally, I'll post my thoughts on recent tech trends, books, or other tech related topics.  I hope that other members of the tech/maker community will find this useful.

Happy Hacking,
Jeff
