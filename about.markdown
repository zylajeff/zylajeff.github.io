I'm a Software Development Manager working for Amazon in the great city of Detroit. In my spare time I like to play around with electronics. I always have something I'm tinkering with, and I recently finished a remote control vehicle controlled via my phone! I generally consider myself a software polyglot and just enjoy building things, regardless of the language. I love learning new things!

Outside of work, I'm a passionate Detroit supporter. I even moved away from the sunny confines of Southern California in order to help reverse the brain drain in Michigan that I contributed to upon college graduation(Go Green!). I'm passionate about the sports, the architecture, and in general the history of Detroit. I love watching the comeback of a once thriving city firsthand!
